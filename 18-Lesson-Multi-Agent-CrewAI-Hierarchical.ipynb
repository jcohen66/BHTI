    "# Module 8: 18 - Multi-Agents with CrewAI - Emulating Corporate Hierarchy\n",
    "-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "In this lesson, we will delve into the use of CrewAI to create and manage multi-agent systems that emulate a corporate hierarchy. CrewAI enables the specification of a custom manager agent or automatically creates one, requiring the specification of a manager language model (manager_llm). This manager agent is responsible for overseeing task execution, which includes planning, delegation, and validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In CrewAI, tasks are not pre-assigned to agents. Instead, the manager allocates tasks to agents based on their capabilities, reviews outputs, and assesses task completion. This hierarchical approach ensures efficient management and execution of tasks, reflecting a real-world corporate structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "* Understand the structure and capabilities of CrewAI for creating hierarchical multi-agent systems.\n",
    "* Implement and configure a manager agent to oversee task execution.\n",
    "* Define agent capabilities and observe the task delegation process.\n",
    "* Analyze the collaboration between agents under the supervision of a manager agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this session covers:\n",
    "* Introduction to CrewAI and its role in emulating a corporate hierarchy in multi-agent systems.\n",
    "* Setting up a manager agent and specifying a manager language model (manager_llm).\n",
    "* Configuring agents with specific capabilities and enabling task delegation by the manager.\n",
    "* Observing and analyzing the manager's role in planning, delegation, and validation of tasks.\n",
    "* Demonstrating the hierarchical approach to task management and execution in a multi-agent system."
